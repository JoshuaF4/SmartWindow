# SmartWindow
Working:
The smart window works by using Hand Gesture movement (powered
by ultrasonic sensors), as well as remote application (powered by
ESP32) , All sensors are relayed to Arduino, which relays its output to
the LED’s and the ESP32 , which also receives from Wi-Fi , which
results in turning of the servo motor.

Components:
● Arduino Uno
● ESP32
● Breadboard
● Servo Motor
● Smoke Sensor
● Water Level Sensor
● Ultrasonic Sensor
● LED
